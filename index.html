        <h2>C Programming</h2>
        <p>
            C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s. It is known for its low-level memory manipulation capabilities and is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and developing various software applications.
        </p>
        <h2>Java Programming</h2>
        <p>
            Java is an object-oriented, high-level programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s. It is known for its platform independence, as Java programs can run on various platforms without modification. Java is commonly used for web development, mobile app development, and enterprise-level applications.
